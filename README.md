# Super-Duper-Linter
Inspired by github/super-linter, but using Powershell.

# Improvements
- Powershell 7 Runner Script
- Linters run independently, a failure in one won't impact others
- Linters are defined as structured objects
- Configuration System for Linters
- Linter Plugin Support
- Linters run in parallel for huge performance increase
- Files to lint are evaluated prior to run, better performance
- Linter results available in both prettyprint and JSON
